### Hi there! I'm Zsolt. ðŸ’› ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º

I'm Zsolt, but you might know me as Yellowberry, or just Yellow. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Some things about me:

- I value optimization (some would say too much)
- I write mediocre code
- I can't swim
- I like wearing bright colors to make myself stand out in crowds
- I'm Hungarian, but I live in the US

Some things I'm interested in:

- [LEGO](https://github.com/OpenLSR/LSRUtil.NET) [Stunt](https://github.com/OpenLSR/SRtoolbox) [Rally](https://github.com/OpenLSR/OpenLSR)
- SimCity 2000
- Modding and reverse engineering old, low-effort or otherwise bad games
- High energy music
- Turning music into input for other things
- Figuring out why my code doesn't work
- **Hopelessly obscure relics of the Internet**

***I'm always happy to review pull requests for any of my projects, if you'd like to help out!***

If you need to contact me, you can do so from any of the listed methods at [https://yello.ooo](https://yello.ooo), I try to keep it up to date.
