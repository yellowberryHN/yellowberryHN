### hey! i'm yellow. ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º ðŸ’› ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

thanks for visiting my page!

my name is zsolt, but you may know me by yellow or yellowberry. welcome to my github profile!

a few interesting things about me:

- i put too much effort into optimizing code
- i don't like coffee
- i can't swim
- i like wearing bright colors to make myself stand out in crowds
- i'm Hungarian, but i currently reside in the US

some things i'm interested in:

- a silly little rhythm game called WACCA
- [LEGO Stunt Rally](https://github.com/OpenLSR)
- SimCity 2000
- modding and reverse engineering old, low-effort or otherwise bad games
- high energy music
- turning music into input for other things
- figuring out why my code doesn't work
- **hopelessly obscure relics of the internet**
